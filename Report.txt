The first 10 of the queries were working efficiently and the time was below 50 milliseconds. However after the first 10, it started going over the 300 milliseconds requirement and some were getting around 8-10 seconds. We realized that it would be more efficient to read smaller chunks of indices into memory and processing those rather than reading bigger chunks which take longer to read from the disk. After that change, all of the queries were found within 50 milliseconds.
